## ÂµTCP - Transmission control protocol

ALPHA: This is still under development and not yet ready for being used.

This repository contains a TCP stack with a pure functional core. Its design is
close to the [HOL4 specification](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/Netsem/alldoc.pdf)
developed in the [Netsem](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/Netsem/) project -
have a look at the
[overview paper](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/Netsem/paper3.pdf) if interested.
The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rems-project/netsem) is the current
development head - and the code in here uses the FreeBSD-CURRENT branch.
If you find function names that are confusing, its worth to look into the NetSem
specification, there may exist a rule with the same name with same behaviour.

In contrast to the basic TCP [RFC 793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793), some
features are excluded:
- Out of band data (urgency, urgent pointers)
- No backlog queue, lots of connections have to be throttled elsewhere
- Timestamps

Very informative to read is [RFC 7414](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7414) - a
roadmap for TCP specification documents, and
[RFC 9293](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9293) TCP
specification (which combines and obsoletes several RFCs).

Initially, I thought timestamp option would be a good idea, but then they mainly
are privacy risks exposing a global counter (you could do a per-connection
timestamp), and add _12_ bytes to _every_ segment for basically no benefit (see
https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2017-07-20-s3-mystery/ for some discussion
thereof).

In contrast to above specifications, the state transition diagram is different
in this implementation. The reason is that not the full Unix sockets API is
implemented, especially listening sockets are treat specially instead of being
fused into the state machine: each (passive) connection starts in the
SYN_RECEIVED state, there is no LISTEN state. There is also no CLOSED state -
a connection which would end up in this state is directly dropped.

Features included in this implementation that have been specified in later RFCs:
- [RFC 1337](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1337) - TIME-WAIT Assassination hazards
- [RFC 4987](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4987) - SYN-flood attacks
- [RFC 5927](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5927) - ICMP Attacks
- [RFC 5961](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5961) - blind in-window attacks
- [RFC 6528](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6528) - defending against sequence number attacks
- [RFC 7323](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7323) - TCP Extensions for high-performance

## Intentional differences to the NetSem specification

The specification covers all valid executions of what is known as TCP. This is
an implementation taking choices (sometimes early) and not implementing the full
specification - sometimes even violating it on purpose!

A plan is to use the specification and the test harness (+packetdrill and the
FreeBSD TCP testsuite) to validate that the implementation behaves according to
the specification. Since the specification is at the moment specialised on
FreeBSD-12, this will likely need some work. In this place, I attempt to document
which bits and pieces need to be touched. For reference, all comments and line
numbers are refering to git commit 2374ad26b2f4f32f62aaea62ac641c3a91b2efbc
(mostly actually 409966517e3468bc677d58f46756957d4a1dddb0, because the other is
rather private).

We'll likely need to define a new ARCH for this implementation in the model and
then hope it's good enough ;) (or only run tests which behave similat to
FreeBSD).

- Appropriate Byte Counting (this is what I intend to implement)
- Initial window size (that may already be in my FreeBSD12 changeset)
- Incoming urgent flag (not handled in the implementation)
- More restrictive with flag combinations (only one of SYN FIN RST)
- CLOSED state can't be observed
- going from TIME_WAIT anywhere (i.e. when someone connects with a socket, and instead close on EOF does another connect - this may actually happen; if you're talking to this library, your second connect will fail.... hope you handle the case properly) - deliver_in_9 will never happen for us
- TCP_NEWRENO is true (we skip the conditionals)
- We have infinite resources (well, of course not, but: on the send edge the buffer is provided by the caller (and then owned by us); on the receive side the buffer is provided by the caller as well) -> we don't really allocate data (apart from some records/..), but we nevertheless limit rcvbufsize to 2^16 (should be user-configurable)
- There is no bandwidth limitation, output always succeeds (this simplifies a lot)! -> no rollback / enqueue_or_fail

Model anomalies:
- is tcp option size computation good in timer_tt_rexmtsyn_1? (missing MSS)
- tt_persist doesn't check whether shift + 1 is < tcp_maxrxtshift
- di3_ackstuff: hostLTS:452 "ack <= snd_una", but text "strictly less than snd_una"
- di3_newackstuff: hostLTS:251 uses "cb'.snd_nxt" which is the same (and a no-op)
- we update rcv_wnd (of the control block) in tcp_output_really, the model does not (see TCP1_hostTypesScript.sml:538 - they compute the rcv_wnd lazily)

## TODO

- I copied over various functions which need to be properly tested:
   - RTT measurement
   - maximum segment size computation
   - all duration and timer computations...
   - should data = [] be more explicitly assert in early handshake?
     from what I understand: SYN may not carry data (apart from TFO where server may send data in SYN+ACK); RST may carry data (that's the "error message"), FreeBSD may (used to?) send random sndq data
- error handling (temporary errors / error types to present)
- error propagation: cb can get some errors (from ip / icmp)
   (maybe temporary) which are preserved in softerror, and bubble up
   [also timeouts] <- this is to-be-returned when connect/read/write/close fails
- path MTU discovery (RFC 1191, ICMP)
- when is t_maxseg set? is it modified at all? (should not be once ESTABLISHED is reached)
- t_badrxtwin <- meh (don't understand its value and usage)
- really need to ensure that we're not talking to ourselves in Segment.decode_and_verify...
- the rcv_window computations are done for bad segments (di_2a/7c/7d) on BSD as well, but we don't need that behaviour
- verify with RFC 9293 at hand
- appropriate byte counting (RFC 3456, not in the HOL4 model, though :/)
- increased initial window size
- make the bsd_fast_path a fast path for us ;)
- SACK
- tcp_output_really and tcp_do_output have quite some code shared...
- keepalive is in the model, could easily be copied over
- put cc in a separate module, follow FreeBSD design ack_received / after_idle / conf_signal / post_recovery

## Testing

- packetdrill-like scripts!?
- luckily with a pure API we can test this directly (no need for sockets, and
  actual wire transmission)
- downside is we need to develop/adapt a syntax for packet building (and
  expected answers within time boundaries), and write the test cases
  (but then I'm not really able to find well-engineered tests with packetdrill
   - yes, the FreeBSD suite is nice, but contains quite some copy + paste)
   also, packetdrill is GPL (but lots of tests BSD3)
- maybe we can have both -- first our own tests, at a later point write a
  packetdrill remote helper that translates commands into OCaml calls and
  this way execute and evaluate those tests
- https://github.com/freebsd-net/tcp-testsuite/tree/master/state-event-engine
- there's also tthee (part of netsem), extensive ad-hoc tests (with remote
  helpers) of unix sockets API - the traces have been evaluated with FreeBSD
  4.6 to some degree!

### Test notes

a matrix from testing LISTEN and CLOSED ports, tested with FreeBSD and Linux:

```
                 LISTEN               CLOSED
            FreeBSD   Linux      FreeBSD     Linux
NONE           -        -          RST+ACK(2) RST+ACK(2)
FIN            -        -          RST+ACK(2) RST+ACK(2)
FIN+ACK(+data)  RST     RST        RST        RST
ACK(+data)      RST     RST        RST        RST
RST(+ACK)(+SYN)(+FIN)-  -           -          -
SYN          SYN+ACK    SYN+ACK    RST+ACK(2) RST+ACK(2)
SYN+ACK         RST     RST        RST        RST
SYN+FIN(+data)SYN+ACK(1)  -        RST+ACK(2) RST+ACK(2)
SYN+data     SYN+ACK(1) SYN+ACK(1) RST+ACK(2) RST+ACK(2)
```

1: only the SYN is acked, not FIN or data!
2: ACK includes data and fin

## Further notes

- from rationale.txt:208 cantrcvmore: this is equivalent to ``st IN {CLOSE_WAIT, LAST_ACK, CLOSING; TIME_WAIT; CLOSED}``.  And FIN_WAIT_1???
  invariants.txt:101 says "If cantrcvmore is set, then rcvq never grows."
  Hypothesis:
  cantrcvmore <== st IN { CLOSE_WAIT; LAST_ACK; FIN_WAIT_1; FIN_WAIT_2; CLOSING; TIME_WAIT }
  ~cantrcvmore <== st IN { ESTABLISHED; SYN_SENT; SYN_RCVD }
  think we don't care in LISTEN or CLOSED.
  ==> if we believe this, we should remove cantrcvmore.
  (note that cantsndmore is different; it merely records that we intend
  to send a FIN (and change state) at some point in the future (not
  necessarily now).)
- RCVTIMEO and SNDTIMEO <- what exactly do they time? until accepted in
  sndq/rcvq?
